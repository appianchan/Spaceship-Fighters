## Spaceship-Fighters

Spaceship-Fighters is my interpretation of space invaders! You command a space ship to shoot down other enemies! Win each stage by shooting down all enemies in that stage. Everytime you get hit by an enemy, you lose a life. Once you have no lives, you lose. Play the game here at https://appianchan.github.io/Spaceship-Fighters/
