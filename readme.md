##Spaceship-Fighters

Spaceship-Fighters is my interpretation of space invaders.

#How to play
You will command a space ship to shoot down other enemies! Win each stage by shooting down all enemies in that stage. 
Everytime you get hit by an enemy or by an enemy bullet, your health will go down. Once your health reaches 0, you will lose. 
You gain points by shooting down enemies, and your score will be recorded at the end. The top 10 players with the most points
will be able to put his or her name on the high score screen.
